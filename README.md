# Simple-Wind-Speed-Prediction-Interface-With-Flask

This project is a simple web interface project to predict wind speed using flask based on Air Temperature (T), Atmospheric Pressure (P), Wind Direction (DD), and Dew Point Temperature.

The results of the prediction are 8 classes, namely:
"Calm", "Light air", "Light breeze", "Gentle breeze", "Moderate breeze", "Fresh breeze", "Strong breeze"

prediction method using:
multi-layer Perceptron
